# Ideas

### TODO

- Check out the GHC public speaking course for inspo
- Track down videos of me presenting at hackathons when it's been streamed, use as background
- Clean up final slide - get photos of logos, etc
- Fontawesome icons per slide
- Finish prepping for potential questions
- Bonus - take reveal.js live at `FeedMeRa.men` with the whole client-server shebang

## Potential questions

- How did you make your website?
	- Started by learning HTML and CSS on Codecademy.
	- Introduced to Bootstrap and web frameworks at uni
	- Started with a Bootstrap 3 template and worked on recreating it myself
- Where do I start?
	- Take Compsci GCSE
	- If it's too late, learn you a Python and web dev
	- Initiatives like CodeFirst Girls are helpful
	- Most universities are involved in the student hackathon scene
	- Companies run hackathons too - Facebook will run one in London next year as far as I know

## Hackathons

### Things to cover

- What is a hackathon? (Try to recite the age-old MLH explanation)
- Why do people worry about them?
	- Lack of skill
	- Lack of a team
	- Travelling
- My experiences
	- GreatUniHack
		- First hackathon, on my own - could talk about inclusivity
	- HackNotts
		- The less desirable side of hackathons - teammates going AWOL, cold sleeping area, food, etc.
	- MLH Prime EU
		- What MLH and GitHub do for the hackathon community - hiring out Bloomberg HQ, amazing food and experience
		- Hackathons as a learning experience - gave it all we had
	- Cal Hacks 4.0
		- Hackathons at scale - 150-300 vs. 2000
		- Could throw in the Cali stuff as an aside
	- HackSheffield 3.0
		- The urge to hack, even despite jetlag!
	- BrumHack 7.0
		- Going solo, starting small
	- Becoming a HackSheffield organiser
		- Giving back

## California

### Things to cover

- Cal Hacks 4.0
- GitHub Universe
	- could show a clip of a talk I saw now they're up
- Living in a hostel
- Wandering around the Googleplex
- GitHub HQ 3.0 - pizza with the Octocrew
- Campus Experts course

### Aims

- TODO: It'd be great to talk about but I don't feel like it'd give them much

## General

- Linux, my setup
	- Starting with Ubuntu
	- The terminal
	- Moving to Manjaro
	- Looking for inspiration
		- /r/unixporn
		- /g/
		- i3
- Vim?
- Why you should edit in plaintext
- Opportunities available to you at uni - Cali, Super Mario Odyssey

# Scrapped ideas

## Git tutorial (scrapped?)

### How do I make it simple?

- Use GitHub as the interface
- Take it slow
	- Might not have much time - think I only had 40 minutes last time. It's a lot to take in and probably isn't as effective
